# personal-diary
personal diary app using Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP, and HTML

## features
1. create diary entry, edit diary entry, and delete diary entry
2. create users, edit profile, and delete users

## note
- default login username is ```lycusfelicius``` with password ```root```
- register new user by open ```https://yourdomain.com/personal-diary/register.php``` after logging in

## future ideas
- [ ] create text editor for diary entry (i will likely use ckeditor for the future release)
- [ ] remake the front-end website (tbh this version wasn't ready for release)
